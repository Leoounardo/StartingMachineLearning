# I WANTED TO GET RICH, BUT I FAILED

Hello, my name is Leonardo.
I was looking at the internet betting sites, when suddenly I came across "CSGOEMPIRE".
And well, as a good programmer, my eyes grew. 
I browsed the site thoroughly, and saw that they made all the roulette history available, all separated in order. And it was there, that my heart almost stopped.
Even though I know almost nothing about machine learning and web scraping, I decided that I could find a way to predict all the roulette, 
and thus make a passive income with bets and then get rich. 
So, I decided to research in depth, machine learning models, how to navigate a website in lines of code and so on.
But then, luckily for me, there is no way to predict random phenomena. i confess that i was not disappointed, after all, i learned several concepts.
